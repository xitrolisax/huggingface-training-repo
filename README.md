# HuggingFace Training and Stable Diffusion UI Generation

This repository contains multiple projects using HuggingFace's `diffusers` and `transformers` libraries for training models, generating images, and performing text-related tasks such as sentiment analysis and text classification. The projects within this repository cover a wide range of applications, from generating user interface designs to fine-tuning pre-trained models for custom use cases.

## Project Overview

This repository includes the following key workflows:

1. **UI Design Generation with Stable Diffusion**

   - Generates UI mockups based on text prompts using a fine-tuned version of Stable Diffusion with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
   - **File**: `generate_ui.py`

2. **Training with LoRA**

   - Fine-tunes Stable Diffusion models on custom datasets using LoRA to adapt large pre-trained models for specific tasks, such as UI design generation.
   - **File**: `train_lora.py`

3. **ControlNet Integration**

   - Uses ControlNet with Stable Diffusion to control image generation based on structural inputs like pose estimation.
   - **File**: `controlnet_integration.py`

4. **Sentiment Analysis & Text Classification**

   - Uses HuggingFaceâ€™s transformer models (BERT, GPT-2, etc.) for sentiment analysis and text classification tasks.
   - **File**: `sentiment_analysis_and_classification.py`

5. **Text Generation with GPT-2**
   - Generates creative text using a pre-trained GPT-2 model, allowing for diverse text generation tasks.
   - **File**: `text_generation_with_gpt2.py`

### Usage

1. UI Generation with Stable Diffusion
   File: generate_ui.py

This script allows you to generate UI designs from a text prompt using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned with LoRA.

2. Fine-Tuning with LoRA
   File: train_lora.py

This script fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion model using your custom dataset with LoRA for more efficient training.

3. ControlNet Integration
   File: controlnet_integration.py

This script integrates ControlNet to guide the generation of images based on specific control inputs, such as pose or structure.

4. Sentiment Analysis & Text Classification
   File: sentiment_analysis_and_classification.py

This script performs sentiment analysis and text classification using transformer-based models like BERT.

5. Text Generation with GPT-2
   File: text_generation_with_gpt2.py

This script uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate text based on a given prompt.
